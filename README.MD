# TODO
- Actual back-end
- Database
- Support login with social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, LINE, ...etc)


# Technical Details
- React, ReactRouter, Redux
- Semantic UI (Badly configured, cannot load icon when compiled by webpack)
- Font-Awesome
- jquery
- lodash
- webpack
- expressjs
- supervisor and react component hot-loader integrated
- For now there is no database, service is reading static JSON files

# Build guide
- npm install
  - You can skip configuring Semantic UI
- npm run dev-server
  - need supervisor installed globally
